## 🔍 About Me

I am a cybersecurity researcher with deep expertise in:

- Web application security and bug bounty hunting
- Open source security / vulnerability discovery
- Binary analysis and reverse engineering
- Linux OS internals, containerization, and virtualization
- Embedded / router firmware and networking

My approach combines offensive mindset with deep systems knowledge: when I test web apps, I often trace vulnerabilities down to low-level components, dependencies, or runtime behavior.
