Hey, I am Huang, Xuan (a.k.a. _@huxpro_). I worked on the [React Team](https://beta.reactjs.org/community/meet-the-team#react-core) at <del>Facebook</del>Meta.

I considered myself as a hybrid between a software engineer specifically into the programming languages theories and implementations domain (i.e. compiler, type system, type-based formal verification, virtual machine, runtime systems, garbage collection), and a creative technologiest deeply caring about many humanistic aspects (e.g. visual, sound, interaction) in UI and HCI in general.

I also worked on the [Hermes JavaScript Engine](https://hermesengine.dev/), some other projects under the [Reality Labs (Research)](https://tech.fb.com/ar-vr/), and [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/) (now [ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org/)) efforts at Meta (Facebook).

In the past, I worked on [Alitrip (Fliggy)](https://www.alitrip.com/) mobile and web apps under the [Alibaba Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alibaba_Group), found and lead front-end infrastructure team at an unicorn startup company [Beijing Weiying (a.k.a. WePiao, now acquired by Maoyan)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/beijing-weiying-technology), and helped [Ele.me (now acquired by Alibaba)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ele.me) to upgrade their mobile web site into [the first influential PWA (progressive web app) in China](https://medium.com/elemefe/upgrading-ele-me-to-progressive-web-app-2a446832e509).

I studied BA, Digital Media Art at [Communication University of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_University_of_China) and MS, Computer Science (with a focus on programming languages, mainly supervised by [Prof. Matthew Fluet](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~mtf/)) at [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester_Institute_of_Technology).

# [Peter Teoh]

**Cybersecurity Researcher | Bug Bounty Hunter | Systems & Container Specialist**

---

## 🔍 About Me

I am a cybersecurity researcher with deep expertise in:

- Web application security and bug bounty hunting
- Open source security / vulnerability discovery
- Binary analysis and reverse engineering
- Linux OS internals, containerization, and virtualization
- Embedded / router firmware and networking

My approach combines offensive mindset with deep systems knowledge: when I test web apps, I often trace vulnerabilities down to low-level components, dependencies, or runtime behavior.

## 🛠 Technical Domains & Tools

| Domain | Key Focus / Tools |
|---|---|
| Web App Security & Bug Bounty | OWASP vulnerabilities (XSS, SSRF, RCE, etc.), Burp Suite, ZAP, custom fuzzers |
| Binary / Reverse Engineering | IDA Pro, Ghidra, radare2, custom patches & exploit dev |
| OS & Kernel | Linux internals, memory management, syscall hooking |
| Container & Virtualization | Docker, LXC, KVM, libvirt, security isolation (namespaces, cgroups) |
| Networking & Embedded | Firmware analysis, WiFi / router platforms, custom packet tooling |

## 🌐 Selected Contributions & Projects

Below are some representative areas (you can swap with your actual projects / write-ups):

- **Bug bounty reports & public write-ups**
  I have contributed to public bug bounty write-ups and lessons in the community (e.g. how researcher write-ups frame the attacker mindset).
  (See example: *“Bug bounty: feedback, strategy and alchemy”* — general reflections in the bounty community) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

- **Academic & system security research**
  I follow and sometimes contribute to security research such as browser security systematization (e.g. *SOK: On the Analysis of Web Browser Security*) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
  or methods like embedding attack detection into web apps (e.g. *BlackWatch*) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

- **Open-source & community work**
  I engage in or audit open-source projects, sometimes participating in bug bounty programs for OSS maintainers. There is recent academic analysis of how maintainers review and resolve bug bounty reports in open source settings. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

- **Container / virtualization hardening experiments**
  (You would insert links or descriptions of your own projects here, e.g. secure container escape proofs, kernel module sandboxing, etc.)

- **Router / firmware / network hacks**
  (You would also include links to public audit reports, disclosures, or write-ups you have authored.)
