**Cybersecurity Researcher | Bug Bounty Hunter | Systems & Container Specialist**

## 🔍 About Me

I am a cybersecurity researcher with deep expertise in:

- Web application security and bug bounty hunting
- Open source security / vulnerability discovery
- Binary analysis and reverse engineering
- Linux OS internals, containerization, and virtualization
- Embedded / router firmware and networking

My approach combines offensive mindset with deep systems knowledge: when I test web apps, I often trace vulnerabilities down to low-level components, dependencies, or runtime behavior.

## 🛠 Technical Domains & Tools

| Domain | Key Focus / Tools |
|---|---|
| Web App Security & Bug Bounty | OWASP vulnerabilities (XSS, SSRF, RCE, etc.), Burp Suite, ZAP, custom fuzzers |
| Binary / Reverse Engineering | IDA Pro, Ghidra, radare2, custom patches & exploit dev |
| OS & Kernel | Linux internals, memory management, syscall hooking |
| Container & Virtualization | Docker, LXC, KVM, libvirt, security isolation (namespaces, cgroups) |
| Networking & Embedded | Firmware analysis, WiFi / router platforms, custom packet tooling |

## 🌐 Selected Contributions & Projects

Below are some representative areas (you can swap with your actual projects / write-ups):

- **Bug bounty reports & public write-ups**
  I have contributed to public bug bounty write-ups and lessons in the community (e.g. how researcher write-ups frame the attacker mindset).
  (See example: *“Bug bounty: feedback, strategy and alchemy”* — general reflections in the bounty community) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

- **Academic & system security research**
  I follow and sometimes contribute to security research such as browser security systematization (e.g. *SOK: On the Analysis of Web Browser Security*) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
  or methods like embedding attack detection into web apps (e.g. *BlackWatch*) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

- **Open-source & community work**
  I engage in or audit open-source projects, sometimes participating in bug bounty programs for OSS maintainers. There is recent academic analysis of how maintainers review and resolve bug bounty reports in open source settings. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

- **Container / virtualization hardening experiments**
  (You would insert links or descriptions of your own projects here, e.g. secure container escape proofs, kernel module sandboxing, etc.)

- **Router / firmware / network hacks**
  (You would also include links to public audit reports, disclosures, or write-ups you have authored.)
